    "This notebook goes through the steps involved in numerically integrating ordinary differential equations that we will see in this course that are are tricky (or impossible) to solve analytically. We use the built-in ODE solver from the scipy package, called **odeint**. The main advantage of this approach is that, unlike in Euler's method, which uses fixed time steps, odeint automatically adjusts the time steps. This is useful in stiff problems that have multiple different time scales. Enzymatic conversions are a good example of this, where in the first part of the reaction where  𝑆>>𝐾𝑚  conversion is linear with time and we can take large time steps, but when the substrate begins to run out  (𝑆≈𝐾𝑚) , a large time step might introduce numerical error (e.g. leading to a negative substrate concentration).\n",
    "\n",
    "**TMI:** scipy.integrate.odeint is a python wrapper around the FORTRAN function LSODA, which automatically switches between stiff and non-stiff solvers based on evaluation of eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix. You don't get a choice in what solver gets used. If you want more control (perhaps you know something more about the behavior of your system), you can use **scipy.integrate.solve_ivp** or **scipy.integrate.ode** instead, which allows to explicitly choose the solver you want to use. solve_ivp is newer, but at the moment is slower (at least for problems I've tried) and is less developed than odeint.\n",
